# Portfolio

## Description

HTML OVERVIEW

For my HTML file, I started off by adding all the basics and filling in each section. I imagined what I wanted my portfolio to look like then I added all of the information that I thought necessary. After altering my CSS file to make the layout how I wanted, I added buttons to the selectors on the top right of the page and to the images within the work section. Lastly, I went through and added alt attributes to make my portfolio more accessible.

CSS OVERVIEW

For my CSS file, I started by making everything disasterous colors so it would be easy for me to see all of my changes. Next, I moved everything to the correct position. Once everything was where it was meant to be, I changed the colors to something more soothing and added hover selectors to the buttons. Lastly, I was back and forth between my phone and computer making sure my portfolio looked nice on my phone as well as my computer.
